enter an OTP (123456) on the second screen.
2. Once the person has logged in, you have to complete 2 functionalities. List of restaurants
used to discover places & image superimposing which are explained below.
3. The List of restaurants will have an api to show nearby places. This will be a REST API. (PFA
Dummy UI file for design)
4. On clicking each restaurant, on the next screen you will have to show the image of that
restaurant in the center & superimpose this image with the fastor logo(PFA) in the center.
Once this is done, you will now allow the user to share this image from the browser to any
application. This will allow your application to become a progresssive web application.
5. Bonus: This point is optional & will have a competitive advantage over other applicants.
a. In point 4, on superimposing you have to allow the users to reposition the fastor
logo anywhere on the restaurant image.
